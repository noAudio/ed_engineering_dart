# Elite: Dangerous Engineering Mats Sorter

This tool allows you to sort a list of materials into their respective categories while engineering your ship. You can keep track of materials you need to collect and tick off those completed. The categories of the materials in the Material Trader are included to reduce the amount of time hunting down for the material you need to trade.
